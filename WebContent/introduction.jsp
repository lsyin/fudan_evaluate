<h3>NLPCC 2015 Introduction
    <p class="lead">    The conference on Natural Language Processing and Chinese Computing (NLPCC) is the annual meeting of the CCF TCCI (Technical Committee of Chinese Information, China Computer Federation).
                        NLPCC is a leading international conference specialized in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Chinese Computing (CC).
                        It serves as a main forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to share their ideas, research results and experiences, and to promote their research and technical innovations in the fields. Previous NLPCC conferences were successfully held in Beijing (2012), Chongqing (2013) and Shenzhen (2014).
                        Today, NLP and CC technologies are among the most active research and development areas due to rapid advancement of the Internet as well as the worldwide proliferation of mobile devices and social media. 
                        The fields are facing many new challenges arisen from intelligent applications and big data, such as business intelligence, social analytics, etc. 
                        The fourth conference of NLPCC will focus on Natural Language Analysis and Understanding in Big Data including Fundamental Research in Language Computing, Multi-Lingual Access, Web Mining/Text Mining, Machine Learning for NLP, Knowledge Graph, NLP for social network, Information Retrieval, Question & Answering as well as the Applications of Language Computing.</p>
